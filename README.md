Social media share buttons
==========================

This project allows you to add "share" links to your webpages without using any code from external web sites. This is very useful for privacy-sensitive sites.

The JavaScript code requires jQuery.

To use this code, you will need to copy the three separate code sections from the index.html file in this repository into your HTML page: CSS, HTML and JavsScript.

Documentation from each site is available here:

### Google+

https://developers.google.com/+/web/share/#sharelink

### Twitter

See the section "Build Your Own Tweet Button"

### Facebook
